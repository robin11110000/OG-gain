# OrbitYield - Cross-Chain Yield Aggregator

![OrbitYield Logo](public/Original-Logo.png)

## üöÄ Overview

OrbitYield is a powerful cross-chain DeFi yield aggregator built on Polkadot that automatically finds and allocates funds to the highest-yielding opportunities across multiple blockchain networks. Our platform eliminates the fragmentation in yield farming by providing a unified interface to optimize returns while minimizing risk.

## üî¥ Problem We Solve

Currently, yield farming opportunities are fragmented across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, etc.), creating several challenges:

- **Fragmentation**: Users must manually monitor and move funds between chains
- **High transaction fees**: Bridging assets between blockchains can be costly
- **Security risks**: Users may unknowingly invest in high-risk pools
- **Inefficient yield strategies**: Without automation, users miss higher returns elsewhere

## ‚úÖ Our Solution

OrbitYield provides a smart contract-powered DeFi platform that:

- Scans multiple blockchains for the highest-yielding opportunities
- Allocates user funds automatically to the best pools
- Monitors yield changes in real-time and rebalances funds
- Assesses risk levels before investing in any liquidity pool
- Supports staking and LP token rewards to enhance user earnings

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Chain Yield Optimization

- Uses AI & oracles (Chainlink, DIA, SubQuery) to scan different DeFi protocols across Polkadot, Ethereum, and other chains
- Identifies liquidity pools, lending platforms, and staking opportunities with the highest APY
- Allocates funds accordingly to optimize returns automatically

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Rebalancing Strategies

- Monitors yield fluctuations & liquidity shifts in real-time
- Automatically withdraws from lower-performing pools and moves funds to better opportunities
- Minimizes impermanent loss by balancing LP token allocations

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Assessment Score for Each Yield Farm

- Uses AI-powered risk evaluation to score each liquidity pool based on:
  - Smart contract security (audit checks)
  - Historical volatility
  - Token stability
  - Market manipulation risks
- Prevents users from investing in risky or unaudited DeFi pools

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ LP Token Staking & Rewards

- Users receive LP tokens when they deposit funds
- LP tokens can be staked for extra rewards
- Supports Polkadot-native staking & governance participation

## üåç Why Polkadot?

OrbitYield leverages Polkadot's unique architecture to enable true cross-chain interoperability:

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability (XCMP & XCM)**: Allows seamless asset transfers between Polkadot, Kusama, Ethereum, and more
- **Lower Gas Fees**: Unlike Ethereum, Polkadot offers scalable, low-cost transactions, making yield optimization more profitable
- **Secure and Customizable Smart Contracts**: Built using both ink! (for Polkadot) and Solidity (for Ethereum compatibility)

## üí° Use Cases

1. **Passive Income Platform**: Users stake assets, and the aggregator automatically grows their funds
2. **Treasury Yield Management for DAOs**: DAOs use the aggregator to manage treasury funds efficiently
3. **Institutional Yield Optimization**: Hedge funds and crypto firms use it to maximize DeFi returns across chains

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Smart Contracts**: ink! (Polkadot), Solidity (Ethereum)
- **Oracles**: SubQuery, Chainlink for real-time APY data
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: XCM & XCMP for seamless asset movement
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other major wallet providers

## üîê Security Features

OrbitYield prioritizes security with:

- Comprehensive smart contract audits
- Multi-signature governance for critical operations
- Risk assessment algorithms for each yield opportunity
- Insurance options for deposited funds
- Transparent admin access and control
